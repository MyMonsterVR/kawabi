# Changelog

User-facing notes on what changed, most recent first. Not every commit gets an
entry -- only things worth telling the reader about. Shown in-app under
Settings -> About -> Changelog.

## Unreleased

- Reading progress now syncs across devices right when you finish a chapter,
  not just on app startup -- fixes progress getting stuck behind on a device
  that stays open a long time (e.g. a tablet).
- Fixed blurry pages on some MangaFire chapters (mainly unofficial/scanlation
  releases) that come as one big stitched image -- these now render at full
  sharpness instead of being downscaled.
- Library refresh is dramatically faster, especially for larger libraries --
  no longer waits on the old one-request-per-manga limit, so it no longer
  slows to a crawl past ~30 manga.
- Added an in-app changelog (Settings -> About -> Changelog) -- you're
  reading it.
- Settings screen redesigned with grouped cards instead of a flat list.
- New reader settings: page fit mode (fit width / fit height / original
  size), an adjustable "mark read at N% scrolled" threshold, and a per-manga
  reading-direction override (accessible from the manga's own page).
- New theming options (Settings -> Appearance): a Catppuccin Mocha palette
  alongside the original look, an AMOLED true-black toggle, and Material You
  dynamic color on Android 12+.
- Fixed missing cover art on roughly half your library -- covers in WebP
  format (common on AsuraScans and some other sources) were failing to load
  entirely. If you still see a missing cover, opening that manga once and
  going back should refresh it.
